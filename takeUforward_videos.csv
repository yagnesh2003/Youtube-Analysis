There is a slight mistake on the logic of Armstrong, it will be 1634 = (1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4), basically digits raised to the power count of digits, so sum = sum + pow(ld, cntDigits) will be the change, where the cntDigits is the number of digits.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hey Everyone, Super glad to announce that the DP series is here! We start on Saturday that is 8th of Jan 2022, I will be releasing a video every day. More details about the playlist will be in tomorrow's video. 

Mark my words, this series is going to be the BEST ever! I am saying this, because I have invested a massive amount of time on just this one topic, from collecting problems to arranging them in the best possible sequence to learn. 

Lastly, I can upload one video daily only, because I got a full-time job. Also all the videos are made and edited by me, so takes a lot of time. 

So lets start from tomorrow!",2022-01-07,1086725,6603,156,Jan
