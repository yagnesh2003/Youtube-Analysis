Here's a high-level intuition if it can help someone. \r\n\r\nWe wish to find a set of eventual safe nodes in the original graph G. Let T be the set of terminal nodes of G. A node 'p' in G is eventual safe if it's neither part of a cycle nor it can 'reach' any cycle. In other words, all the 'outgoing' paths from 'p' can only reach one of the terminal nodes T. Conversely, if 'q' is an unsafe node, then there exists at least one 'outgoing' path which leads to a cycle (or unsafe nodes). Now when we reverse G, in the reversed graph, all the outgoing paths become incoming paths and vice-versa. Let's call the reversed graph H. Note that the 'terminal' nodes T of G becomes the start nodes for the topological sort on H.\r\n\r\nIn the reversed graph H, all the 'incoming' paths to 'p' must start from some terminal node in T (and must contain no cycles). On the other hand, there exists at least one 'incoming' path to 'q' which originates from some unsafe node (connected to a cycle). Now when we perform Kahn's topological sort starting from the terminal nodes T, and repeatedly remove edges from terminal node set to its neighbors, at some point, all 'incoming' edges to 'p' will be removed and its indegree will become 0, and hence 'p' will be collected as a safe node. On the other hand, 'q' will be left with at least one edge (involving unsafe nodes connected to a cycle), and hence its indegree would never become zero, and hence it will not be collected as a safe node."", 'understood', 'I thought of trying a new approach. I initialized and stored outdegree in an array and added the nodes with outdegree 0 to the queue and ran a while loop, in which I eliminate the element with outdegree 0 and added to the safe state list. and reduced the outdegree by 1 of all nodes which points to the initial node.

232,Yz4LlDSlkns,"[""Others are leaving positive reviews, but I feel like Striver spends too much time on intuitive concepts and not enough on the parts that need detailed explanations. For example, when he was explaining how to take the array product, I couldn’t visualize it. Ever since he started with the LIS topic, I’ve been confused. He doesn’t have a consistent template for converting from top-down to bottom-up. He often explains things in a rushed manner and keeps changing his approach to initializing dp arrays. Sometimes it's N, N, other times it's N+1, N+1, or even N+2, N+2. It feels like he just does whatever fits the question without consistency. Also, his loops vary: sometimes from i = N-1 to 0, other times from N to 1. This inconsistency is why people suggest watching Aditya Verma's series instead of Striver's for DP. #Notunderstood 10 videos in a row"", 'better explanation that than neetcode guy', 'Thankyou so much for amazing explanation Striver', 'Nice one !!!', 'understood ', 'Understood, thanks.', 'wow', 'understood', 'Thank you!\nUnderstood!', ""Read many solution where they just told that it's MCM add 1s to start and end that's it, but I didn't find it intuitive... \nThis solution is logical rather than mugging up those solution!""]"

Done with DP. Here I am teaching you 4 concepts. First recursion->recursion tree->memoization->tabulation->space optimization. After this first video, the next videos will be wrapped up in lesser time as you know about DP on grids! For example, the next video wraps up in 12 minutes, the next one wraps up in 24 minutes. Its because this video is long enough to cover all concepts all at once', '""US"", Thankyou so much Striver!,  dont know why but i did this prob by bfs graphs at first , it gave TLE although 😂', 'understood', 'understood', 'Understood! keep it up bro, All best wishes to you', 'Instead of 2d table use a map in java. x_y will be the key', 'HI Aditya, akka Sir @Striver, I am feeling that given m * n matrix , we should keep it reducing its dimension. For example when you are going down it is (m-1, n) and for right (m , n-1) with this our problem space keep reducing. At some point the dimension will reach to (1,1) and yes here we should return 1, But other case (0,1) or (1,0) we can return 0. I feel we are confusing dimension with indexes. Here is my solution : f(x,y) {  if (x ==1 && y ==1) return 1; if(x==0 || y == 0) return 0;  return f(x-1, y) + f(x, y-1);}. Also instead of up and left we should use down and right terminology.', 'UNDERSTOOD !!', 'understood', 'understood sir']"
